## ‚ú® Features

- Lightweight and high performance
- Clean Domain-Driven Design (DDD) structure
- Minimalistic and extendable core
- Core framework located at `vendor/core`
- Easy to learn, easy to contribute

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

SwiftPHP is based on **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** concepts. The project structure separates the main responsibilities into clear layers:

- **Domain Layer**: Business rules (Entities, Value Objects, Repositories)
- **Application Layer**: Application services, use cases
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Database, file system, external services
- **Presentation Layer**: Controllers, Views, API handlers

The **core** logic of the framework is isolated under:

```
vendor/core/
```

This ensures the core remains reusable, stable, and independent of business logic.
